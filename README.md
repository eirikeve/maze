# maze
Maze generator using a randomized Prim's algorithm.  
Can output to a command line interface, or can be included in other projects.  
Written in Python 3.

# Usage
If using directly from terminal, call: `python maze.py height width [random seed]`  
(random seed defaults to 0 if not supplied)

Otherwise, use `getMaze(xlength, ylength, random_seed)`

# Example input
With random seed supplied:
```bash
me@my-computer:~/Folder$ python maze.py 21 21 10
