# maze
Maze generator using a randomized Prim's algorithm.  
Can output to a command line interface, or can be included in other projects.  
Written in Python 3.

# Usage
If using directly from terminal, call: `python maze.py [-h] --height HEIGHT --width WIDTH [--seed SEED | --random]`  
Seed defaults to 0 if  `--seed` or `--random` not supplied.
`--random` generates a maze with a random seed.

Otherwise, use `getMaze(xlength, ylength, random_seed)`

__Example input:__

With seed supplied:
```bash
me@my-computer:~/Folder$ python maze.py --height 21 --width 21 --seed 10
